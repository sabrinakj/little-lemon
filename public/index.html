      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      load this remote  JavaScript code - and even I proxy the request via the proxy property in package.json
      then I will have an error because the indicated url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/courseraap/capstone/main/api.js
      is providing an http response which has as content type "text/plain" instead of "application/javascript" or "text/javascript"
      and therefore the browser is not executing such external javascript code and as a consequence it could not be available
      via the window object in the react components
